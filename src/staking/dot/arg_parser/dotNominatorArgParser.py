    * A `ChillThreshold` must be set and checked which defines how close to the max
    nominators or validators we must reach before users can start chilling one-another.
     * A `MaxNominatorCount` and `MaxValidatorCount` must be set which is used to determine
       how close we are to the threshold.
     * A `MinNominatorBond` and `MinValidatorBond` must be set and checked, which determines  if this is a person that 
       should be chilled because they have not met the threshold bond required.
    This can be helpful if bond requirements are updated, and we need to remove old users who do not satisfy these 
    requirements.
